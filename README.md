# graphblas-verif
*** THIS README AND REPOSITORY ARE WORKS IN PROGRESS ***
Formal verification of the GraphBLAS C API implementation by [Tim Davis](http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/welcome.html) using Frama-C/WP and VeriFast (potentially). Modified versions (for verification) of GraphBLAS 2.0.1 are contained within this repository as well as an unmodified version for comparison. 

The most recent version of GraphBLAS is packaged with SuiteSparse and can be downloaded from [here](http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/suitesparse.html).

# Acknowledgments
I would like to thank Tim Davis for allowing the use and distribution of his GraphBLAS implementation.
