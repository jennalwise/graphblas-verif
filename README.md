*** THIS README AND REPOSITORY ARE WORKS IN PROGRESS: Mostly finalized versions will be available after August 24, 2018 ***

Formal verification of the GraphBLAS C API implementation by [Tim Davis](http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/welcome.html) using [Frama-C](https://frama-c.com/)/[WP](https://frama-c.com/wp.html) and [VeriFast](https://github.com/verifast/verifast) (potentially). Modified versions of GraphBLAS 2.0.1 (for verification) are contained within this repository as well as an unmodified version for comparison. 

For those interested, the most recent version of GraphBLAS is packaged with SuiteSparse and can be downloaded [here](http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/suitesparse.html).
